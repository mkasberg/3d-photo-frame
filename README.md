## Parameters

- **nominal_dimensions** sets the photo size.
- **front_depth** sets the thickness of the frame in front of the photo. A high
  value here will create a shadow box effect.
- **back_depth** makes the photo frame thick or thin.

## Printing Instructions

Your default printer settings are probably fine. Here's what I used:

- PLA
- 0.2mm layer height
- 10% infill

### The Frame

- Print face down without supports.
- Can be printed face up with suppports on the inner edge (e.g. if you want to
  put text on the front). Avoid using supports in the two slots for the back and
  in the hanger hole.

### The Back

- Just print it. No supports needed, and infill doesn't matter since it's so
  thin.
